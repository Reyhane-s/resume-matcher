The opportunity for a graphic designer who would design a poster/flier for the Walk for Suicide event was open and I choose to create a design and submit it for the chance to be featured. My responsibilities involved creating a design that would clearly express the beliefs of the Walk for Suicide event, state information such as the event time and address, and to intrigue the eye and to create interest overall. The event was something I believed to be very important so I took my time on creating the design which took a 2 days, with my ability to create and deliver in a timely manner. My design was actually chosen and used on different social medias of the event and was an experience that I believe helped me learn more about time management, deadlines, communication of information while doing something I enjoy.

My first volunteer job there was a greeter for everyone who had entered the fair, I was to record who came into the park, asking for any donations, and if they wanted to participate in the races or raffles. As the fair days progressed and my skills had shown to improve around the fair goers, I was upgraded to a waiter at many of the stands that were around to sell food. I up-sold the menu items, and beverages to increase the profits that would go towards donations for the dogs. I took the necessary steps to meet customer needs and to resolve any food or service issues. I was able to record the orders, repeat them back in a clear, understandable manner and communicated with the other volunteers. I rotated around, taking on the responsibilities of a cashier, waiter, and greeter to provide the highest service I could give.

Skills Used Business, design & sales skills   This retail store was a newest branch of an old, well established, family owned chain of stores from the east side of the state.  The family had recently hired a new, young general manager.  He was responsible, apparently, for some poor management decisions, resulting in the parent company going into bankruptcy and all stores being shut down.        06/1991   to   09/1994     Owner/Manager      Company Name   –   City  ,   State    Converted 7500 square feet of commercial space into 24 individual offices of varying sizes, several cubicle spaces, large and small conference rooms, reception area, secretarial work area and lounge.

Building was sold in 1993 and new owner had other plans for the space and refused to renew the lease.  I had moved the business once and paid for build-out of this space.  I couldn't afford to move again; decided to close business instead.

Prepared construction documents and details to implement design concepts.   Established at the time of graduation from design school, I began my independent career, on a full-time basis.  When business was slow (due to recession, etc.) I accepted employment with well established firms.  I have continued to serve many repeat clients and referrals over the years.       Transitional Vocation    In 1981, before the advent and common use of CAD programs, I had a serious injury to my right (drawing) hand.  I was owner of income properties and had been managing income propertiesfor other individual owners.  Since I was not going to be able to use my hand again for drawing for some time, I took a position as a manager of a 160 unit apartment project that was only 50% occupied.  Within six months, all units were rehabbed, rentable and occupied, and 95-100% occupancy was maintained while I was manager.    In 1983, I was offered a position with another firm as Project Manager during construction and Start-Up Manager of a 360 unit apartment complex.  Being involved at the inception, I was able to revise apartment floor plans to made accommodation for the most common objections I heard while marketing existing floor plans.  My revised plans were very successful and apartments were filled as fast as they were built, with a long waiting list.  Approximately 1/3 of the tenants from the first project I had managed, moved to the new complex, which was extremely gratifying.  I continued in this position to the end of construction.  During that time, I attended property management courses and earned a Residential Property Management Certificate.  My hand was rehabilitated by this time and I decided it was time to return to my real passion, interior design.        Education     1970     Associate of Arts  :   architectural/interior design     New York School of Interior Design   -   City  ,   State      Architecture and interior design history   Fine arts history   Color theory and application   Light theory and application   Textiles  Upholstery  Window treatments  Paint, surface textures, wallcoverings  Interior building materials  Architectural drawing and perspective rendering  Business and marketing principles for designers    All courses were taught by professionals in their respective fields with years of practical experience.         1967     Associate of Arts  :   business principles and skills     Lansing Business University (Davenport Business College)   -   City  ,   State      Basic business management principles  Business law  Office management    Accounting/bookkeeping  Office skills (typing, shorthand, business machines, etc.)  Business etiquette           Skills    Accounting, advertising, Basic, business law, business writing, computer aided design, Color, com, client, clients, drafting, Edit, email, Interior Design, marketing, Materials, window, rendering, retail, sales skills, sales, shorthand, space-planning, specification, phone, typing   "

efforts for a major department modernization project involving 3
accreditation packages each leading to successful Authorization To
Operate decisions.  Responsibilities then increased to include all
departmental accreditation efforts leading to another 3 successful
ATOs.  Now, working on 4 new accreditation including
re-authorization for an existing project.  Succeeded in writing and
implementing vulnerability management for existing accredited
systems.





Success
of the accreditation hinged on coordination with ONI Enterprise in
critical design decisions and to help the program integrate smoothly
into the Enterprise thru many meetings, analyzing the Enterprise
business model to understand the best fit for the program.





The
different projects required careful management of specific STIG
compliance and hardening for the different configurations and
services required for the specific domain to be integrated.   Analyzed complex computer systems to assess vulnerability and risk.    Supervised  5  external computer consultants and vendors.    Managed application patches, data backup, security changes and network configuration.           Company Name    City  ,   State    Systems Engineer   02/2006   to   02/2011        I was Hired
to initiate processing strategies in fulfilling department analyst requirements.  Requirements were fulfilled thru i dentifying product problems and strengths and collected data on customer experience  and review of Enterprise compliance to transition to new
technology for supporting new processing needs thru proper processing
power.  The next challenge  came as storage requirements for better performance and more
controlled uses.  After careful study of local infrastructure design, a local storage with off the shelf solutions was
adopted to grow local storage to over 200TB.  In using this solution,
the department saved just over a million dollars in purchasing and
maintenance costs compared to the alternative. Next came requirements to improve processing of future big data formats fulfilled in a Red Hat Linux high compute cluster I designed, purchased and
accredited for operation in the Enterprise.  Improvement on big data analytical processing reduced time from
30 hours to 30 minutes as well as allow for more robust data thru
higher selections of sensors, frequencies and range than allowed thru
the traditional process.         Company Name    City  ,   State    Senior Systems Analyst   02/1999   to   02/2006        I was hired to improve corporate and
client communications and processing requirements which resulted in
the design, build and deployment of 3 Enterprise network solutions.  One
solution resulted in expanding capabilities to supporting Washington
Navy Yard, Norfolk Virginia and Hawaii support facilities. 






Fulfilled
requirements for detecting crucial network software/hardware
weaknesses and developing preventive strategies and solutions for
avoiding interruptions and increasing system security thru
documenting system layouts, wiring diagrams and addressing schema to
understand layouts and make informed solutions to upper management.

This in of itself, speaks to the trust and value I provide the organization.  I was hired to design, and deploy the first data center the company owned in its efforts to deploy a new offering, an enterprise Software as a Service (SaaS) product.  I was initially an employee of an Adsystech customer working with the Adsystech EVP on an enterprise County Wide project and posed the idea that they should move from ""selling"" software to ""renting"" it via an up and coming model SaaS.  Today, everyone is using SaaS products and paying monthly for various products but in 2004 (when I initially made the proposal) it was an exciting and new potential market which I leveraged to increase the returns at Adsystech and most importantly, generate new recurring revenue.  I was hired in 05' to put in place all things SaaS, this included designing a data center from the ground up, creating cyber security policies and controls, putting together a team to support the data center as well as a team to provide technical support for the new product offering.  As an early adopter, in 2008 I designed and deployed a hybrid cloud environment in our data center.  Again in 08' this was a new technology but my decision demonstrates foresight in emerging technologies and understand in the value of leveraging technology to become more efficient and financial prudent.

When you are writing letters, it's important to select a font that is clear and easy to read.  Here's how to choose a letter font that is professional and readable, as well as how to choose the appropriate font size for your letter.  It is important to select a font that is large enough so that the reader doesn't have to squint to read your letter, but not so big that your letter doesn't fit well on a page.  Use a Basic Font Using a simple font will ensure that your letter is easy to read.  Basic fonts like Arial, Verdana, and Times New Roman work well.  Depending on how much content you have in your letter select a 10 or 12 point font size.  It's best if you can format your letter so it fits on one page.  Regardless of the font size you select, there needs to be space at the top of the letter and between each paragraph and each section of your cover letter.  Here's how to space your cover letter.  When you are using Microsoft Word, here is how to select a font for your letter and how to select the font size.  If you're using a different word processing program, the process is similar.  Select the content of your cover letter then choose a font and a font size.  You may need to try a couple of different sizes to make sure that your cover letter fits on a single page.  How to Select a Cover Letter Font Select a font from the list at the top of your document before you start writing your letter, or: Type your cover letter.  Highlight the content of your letter.  Either select the font from the pop-up window or select the font from the list at the top of the document.        Experience      Production Associate   03/2006   to   Current     Company Name   City  ,   State       cover letter typically accompanies each resume you send out.  Your cover letter may make the difference between obtaining a job interview or having your resume ignored, so it makes good sense to devote the necessary time and effort to writing effective cover letters.  A cover letter should complement, not duplicate, your resume.  Its purpose is to interpret the data-oriented, factual resume and add a personal touch.  A cover letter is often your earliest written contact with a potential employer, creating a critical first impression.  Find out more of the differences between a resume and a cover letter.  There are three general types of cover letters: The application letter which responds to a known job opening (review samples) The prospecting letter which inquires about possible positions (review samples) The networking letter which requests information and assistance in your job search (review samples) Your cover letter should be designed specifically for each purpose outlined above as well as for each position you seek.  Do not design a form letter and send it to every potential employer (you know what you do with junk mail!).  Effective cover letters explain the reasons for your interest in the specific organization and identify your most relevant skills or experiences (remember, relevance is determined by the employer's self-interest).  The letter should express a high level of interest and knowledge about the position.  Keep in mind that your cover letter doesn't need to be long - a page is plenty.  Here's information on how long a cover letter should be.

The features that are available simplify the way their suppliers can access required business & technical information, as well as how they can provide P&W with valuable delivery information. It is one of the main communication portals and it plays a major role in doing business with Pratt & Whitney. Apart from SharePoint 2010, we used SQL Server 2012 and ASP.Net to develop this application. 4) eRFA (electronic Request For Agreement): RFA is an agreement between two parties (Company and Client) before they start the work. This process involved more than eight approvers to approve the agreement. The existing process which involves manual submission has many problems such as knowing status of agreement, percentage of completion and approval status etc. The new eRFA application is developed in SharePoint as an electronic application which has more flexible UI to capture all required data and it eliminated most of the manual efforts in terms of searching for online results and internal applications to validate the data entered by requester, more flexible approval process and status tracking. 5) Export Logging Tool Export Logging Tool is a web based application to collect and log all export activities occurring at Pratt & Whitney Military Engines with a simple interface with an ability to generate various reports required to report of export events. Apart from these features it also includes the facility of uploading bulk data into the database which needs to be validated for the correctness of the data against business rules which determine the type of data that can be uploaded into each column.

441,"{'support', 'segment', 'marketing', 'business', 'material', 'software'}",44,bachelor,"         DIRECTOR OF BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT       Executive Profile    My goal is to use my unique collection of expertise,
experience, and skills gained from my seventeen years as a construction
business development and marketing representative, five years managing a sales
force, six years helping my father run his historic home remodeling business, and
my college education to reach my full potential as an account executive by
helping Visio Financial Services achieve steady, long-term, sustainable growth
by building productive relationships with customers, co-workers, company
leadership, and other stakeholders.      Core Accomplishments       Sales and Marketing     Increased income 112% in 12 months in Austin  Increased market share from 20% to 70% in downtown Atlanta construction market in 12 months  Designed and executed branding plan to change the image of the organization, resulting in significant market share increase in each of 23 major U.S. cities  Investigated markets and target customer issues to create messaging strategy     Market Research     Defined industry segments and identified opportunities in 23 major U.S. cities  Discovered new opportunities in mature markets and developed and led the implementation of  plans to capture significant market share     Account Management     Managed various sized accounts and grew business by providing superb customer service  Successfully grew account sizes in 23 major U.S. markets  Trained local staff to continue the example of growing accounts through excellent client service        Professional Experience      Director of Business Development   04/2005   to   04/2015     Company Name   City  ,   State      Washington, DC I was called upon to develop and implement growth initiatives in the most difficult scenarios. Whether in low market share environments or during construction recessions or a combination of both, I significantly increased market share in any city to which I was assigned. Through my leadership and supervision, I expanded our market share in Miami, Knoxville, Minneapolis, Dallas, Austin, San Antonio, Tulsa, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Orlando, Denver, Tucson, Houston, New Orleans, Biloxi, New York City, Indianapolis, Birmingham, Nashville, Chattanooga, Sacramento, Modesto, and Fresno.   Following is a partial list of noteworthy accomplishments from those assignments:     Miami  - I developed relationships with building owners in downtown Miami and leveraged those relationships into a group meeting of 17 building owners representing 38 buildings. I delivered a PowerPoint presentation which led to the owners to insist that their building managers give us priority budding status on every project. This one action resulted in substantial growth for my organization.    Minneapolis   - Redesigned the business development program to focus on building relationships with end-users. As a result, the end-users would insist on using us on their projects. Using this approach, I was able to build enough relationships in the construction industry to experience significant growth, even during a downturn in the construction market.     Austin   - I took over the business development program of a unit which had steadily declined its market share. After investigating untapped opportunities, I launched an initiative to pursue a new market. The careful execution of my plan resulted in more than a doubling of business in under 12 months. The relationships built with general contractors and end-users led to expanding our market share into San Antonio, Waco, and Dallas.     Denver   - When I arrived in Denver, out of a list of 200 clients, only 8 were attending monthly informational and sales meetings. I repositioned the agenda away from a ""pitchy, preachy"" sales presentation to an informational, educational, and interactive format. Within three months, attendance at those meetings grew from 8 to over 90 attendees.          Director of Business Development/Political Relations Director   01/1998   to   01/2005     Company Name    North Carlolina, South Carolina, Georgia After only three months as a field representative in Augusta, Georgia, I was promoted to Director of Business Development covering North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia. Shortly afterwards, I was also named the political director for the three states. During my tenure, I focused primarily on growing market share in Atlanta and Charlotte, leveraging client, political, and end-user relationships to grow market share by 90% in the three states, with growth over 100% in Atlanta alone. Following is a partial list of highlights from those assignments: I attended and addressed shareholder meetings of public companies in Atlanta and built personal relationships with CEO's and Directors from Suntrust Banks, Coca-Cola, Georgia Pacific, Genuine Parts (NAPA), Cousins Properties, Rollins (Orkin Pest Control), Equifax, Synovus Banks, and Georgia Power. Leveraged those relationships to secure work at projects for these companies and gained introductions to the executives of other end-users to provide even more bid opportunities. As Political Director, I endorsed and led labor and community groups to support the election of Shirley Franklin for Mayor of Atlanta, making Franklin the first female Mayor of Atlanta and the first African-American female mayor of any major city in the South. I also endorsed and served as labor liaison to Judge Denise Majette and used my contacts and influence to help her unseat Atlanta political powerhouse and multi-term United States Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney.  Additionally, I endorsed and assisted the successful campaigns of the first Hispanic elected to the Georgia State Senate and the first Hispanic elected to the Georgia House of Representatives.        Business Manager/Account Executive   01/1995   to   01/1998     Company Name     State     I served as an apprentice under my father until I graduated high school, and a house we rebuilt on Tradd Street in Charleston, South Carolina, was voted house of the decade in the 1980's by the Preservation Society of Charleston. During and after college, I developed my love for and honed my skills in sales and management while running local Firestone Automotive and Tire Stores and later, business-to-business direct cold-call sales for Transworld Systems, an accounts receivables solutions company.
